    <h3>Mutton Biryani</h3>
    <p>
        Mutton biryani is a delicious Indian dish made with tender pieces of mutton (goat or lamb), 
        fragrant rice, and lots of spices. 
        First, the mutton gets soaked in yogurt and spices to make it tasty. 
        Then, it's cooked together with rice in a big pot. 
        This slow cooking blends all the flavors, making the dish very flavorful and yummy.
